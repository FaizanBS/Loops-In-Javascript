## JavaScript Loop Basics

This repository contains a simple HTML file and a JavaScript file named `javascript.js` that demonstrates the basics of JavaScript loops. This README provides an overview of the repository and instructions on how to use and understand the code.

### Repository Contents

- `index.html`: This HTML file serves as the entry point for the application. It contains a basic structure and includes the JavaScript file.

- `javascript.js`: This JavaScript file contains examples of different types of loops implemented in JavaScript.

### Loop Types

The `javascript.js` file demonstrates three common types of loops in JavaScript: `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops. Each type is explained below:

#### 1. `for` Loop

The `for` loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment or decrement. The loop will continue executing until the condition becomes false.

Example:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log("Iteration: " + i);
}
```

This example will print the message "Iteration: " followed by the current value of `i` for each iteration.

#### 2. `while` Loop

The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. It continues executing as long as the specified condition is true. Make sure to include an increment or decrement statement within the loop to avoid infinite looping.

Example:

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log("Iteration: " + i);
    i++;
}
```

This example will produce the same output as the `for` loop example above.

#### 3. `do...while` Loop

The `do...while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it always executes the code block at least once before checking the condition. It continues executing as long as the specified condition remains true.

Example:

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
    console.log("Iteration: " + i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

This example will also produce the same output as the previous examples.

### Running the Code

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Open the browser's developer console to view the output generated by the JavaScript code.

4. Explore the `javascript.js` file to understand the implementation of different types of loops.

### Conclusion

This repository provides a basic understanding of `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops in JavaScript. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different loop conditions to enhance your understanding.
